													<h3>Accomodations and Food</h3>
												</header>
												<p>For family members we recommend coordinating to arrange shared Airbnbs / VRBOs near the Rose Garden neighborhood in San Jose (see email we have sent out to family for more details). </p>
												<p>For single and/or budget travelers we recommend staying in the Signature Inn or the Sterling Inn near Santa Clara University. Both are clean updated motels at an affordable price near one of our favorite coffee shops (Voyager Coffee - has vegan baked goods) and several restaurants. </p>
												<p>At a higher price point we recommend the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel, Campbell. At the highest price point Hotel Valencia, Santana Row provides a luxury stay within an upscale shopping district.</p>
                                                <p>There are several grocery stores near us including Sprouts, Whole Foods, and Safeway. In the Rose Garden we recommend Luna's Mexican Kitchen and Tee Nee Thai (both with good vegan and vegetarian options), Park Station Hashery (for patio beers), and Zanotto's (for fancy grocery needs). </p>
												<p>Please reach out with questions or concerns.</p>

													<h3>Transportation</h3>
												</header>
												<p> For immediate family members we recommend coordinating between family groups to arrange a shared rental car, especially if you are coming in early. For single travelers rideshare apps (Uber/Lyft) and public transportation are good options especially if flying into SJC. We are also planning on arranging for a transportation service (to and back) from the wedding itself. </p>

													<h3>Airport</h3>
												</header>
												<p>The easiest airport to fly into is Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport (SJC). However, Oakland (OAK) and San Francisco (SFO) might offer better rates for flights and are only an hour drive away. There are also several train lines that servce San José with service to train stations by our house and near the Signature Inn. </p>
